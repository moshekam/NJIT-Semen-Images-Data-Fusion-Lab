# Human Semen Images - NJIT Data Fusion Lab

### Real Human Semen Samples (Real Semen Images folder)
This repository contains real and simulated human semen image samples. 

The studies in [1-4] used the real semen images found in this repository.

Human semen specimens were collected and processed by the In-Vitro Fertilization laboratories at Penn Fertility Care in accordance with policies of the University of Pennsylvania. Each specimen was allowed to liquefy for 30-40 min at room temperature and was then washed in media. Washing separates sperm cells from seminal plasma and consists of three cycles of centrifugation. First, ≤ 3 mL of semen wass layered onto a 1.0 mL preparation of density gradient media (0.9 mL PureSperm100, Spectrum Technologies and 0.1 mL Enhanced WG, modified human tubal fluid with HAS and Gentamicin, Conception Technologies) and was centrifuged for 20 min at 400 g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 mL EnhancedWG and centrifuged again for 5 min at 400 g. Lastly, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet is resuspended in 0.5 mL Enhanced WG and 5 μL was pipetted onto a 20 μm deep Vitrolife MicroCell chamber. A microscope stage warmer was used to regulate the temperature of each sample at 37 ◦C during phase contrast imaging (Description taken from [1]). The semen images were captured at 200x magnifications with framerate of either 15 or 30 fps.

There are 9 samples in total available (ID004 - ID012). The image ID009 and ID012 have been divided into multiple files to be under 25 MB.
